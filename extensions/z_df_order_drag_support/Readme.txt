About the extension:
This extension comes in response to a request for a modified ia script created by 'j.harshaw' on the official egosoft.com forum: https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=181&t=431115#p4991880
Only for the 'order "Police"', although it could be adapted for any order that is not contemplated in the UI and with a 'position' type parameter.
